Unweighted UniFrac is discussed in detail in [IAB](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gregcaporaso/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/blob/master/applications/1-biological-diversity.ipynb), so here we'll just focus on implementation. \n",

We can then apply set operations to find the nodes observed in both samples (the union of the sets of observed nodes), and the nodes observed in either of the samples (the intersection of the sets of observed nodes). The set of nodes observed in only one sample (the unique nodes) is the set of nodes observed in either sample minus the set of nodes observed in both samples.\n",
