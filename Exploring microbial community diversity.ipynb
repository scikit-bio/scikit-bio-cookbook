    "The *88 Soils* study analyzed bacterial communities in 88 soil samples taken from various locations in North and South America. The key finding of the study was that soil pH was significantly correlated with bacterial community composition. The study did not find strong correlation based on geographic location (e.g., latitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebok, we'll reproduce several of the beta diversity analyses that lead to these conclusions. Our analyses will center around two key pieces of data: an unweighted [UniFrac](http://aem.asm.org/content/71/12/8228.abstract) distance matrix (e.g., as produced by [QIIME](http://qiime.org/)) containing distances between soil microbiome samples, and metadata about each soil sample (e.g., pH, latitude, soil moisture deficit, etc.; this is typically referred to as a *mapping file* in QIIME-related studies).\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't include full details on how to generate a distance matrix from amplicon sequence data in this notebook, nor will we provide details about microbial ecology concepts and methodology (e.g., UniFrac, alpha/beta diversity, ordination techniques). For further reading, see the [Studying microbial diversity](http://readiab.org/book/latest/3/1) chapter of [*An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics*](http://readiab.org/) and the tutorials on the [QIIME website](http://qiime.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original sequence data and metadata were obtained from the QIIME database (study 103), which is currently being re-vamped as [Qiita](https://github.com/biocore/qiita), and processed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The OTU table was generated using closed-reference OTU picking with QIIME 1.7.0 and [Greengenes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22134646) 13_8 97% OTUs. [uclust](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/19/2460) was used as the underlying clustering method in `pick_closed_reference_otus.py` with the default 97% similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The unweighted UniFrac distance matrix was generated using [MacQIIME](http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime) 1.8.0 with the following command:\n",

    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The distance matrix and per-sample metadata used here are not identical to the data used in the *88 Soils* publication. The data used here were derived from the publication's original sequencing data, but different processing steps were used here (e.g., different software and/or versions, parameters, reference database, etc.). Thus, the results presented here do not exactly match the publication's results, but we expect to arrive at the same overall biological conclusions."
