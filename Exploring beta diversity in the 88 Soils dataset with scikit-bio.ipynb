      "The *88 Soils* study analyzed bacterial communities in 88 soil samples taken from various locations in North and South America. The key finding of the study was that soil pH was significantly correlated with bacterial community composition. The study did not find strong correlation based on geographic location (e.g., latitude).\n",

      "In this notebok, we'll reproduce several of the beta diversity analyses that lead to these conclusions. Our analyses will center around two key pieces of data: an unweighted [UniFrac](http://aem.asm.org/content/71/12/8228.abstract) distance matrix (e.g., as produced by [QIIME](http://qiime.org/)) containing distances between soil microbiome samples, and metadata about each soil sample (e.g., pH, latitude, soil moisture deficit, etc.; this is typically referred to as a *mapping file* in QIIME-related studies).\n",

The data used here were derived from the publication's original sequencing data, but different processing steps were used here (e.g., different software and/or versions, parameters, reference database, etc.). Thus, the results presented here do not exactly match the publication's results, but we expect to arrive at the same overall biological conclusions."
